## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("move cursor to..." not "moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 50 characters or less
- Limit body to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
- Consider starting the commit message with:
    - `feat:` when adding/updating content for artifact
    - `fix:` when fixing mistake
    - `refactor:` when refactor artifact (without content) or apply strong changes
    - `doc:` when adding/removing/fixing/updating documentation

### Artifactory naming

- Use only English
- For files and directories: kebab case (example: `stream-api`)
